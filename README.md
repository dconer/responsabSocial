# foodFit
The main objective is to inform people about this chair's company. This website portfolio is simple and consists of only one page so I use the necessary CSS to align with the objective. The main takeaway is the design principles I applied to make it stand out and intuitive to the user.

## Usage

This small website is a static website so there is not much to explain in terms of usage.


## How I created

To design this website I have leveraged the following design ingredients:
* Typography: font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
* Colors: 
  + Main color: Amber(#b45309), and their tints and shades.
  + Gray color: #343a40 and different variations of brightness (For text)
  + I also used [coloors](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5) website for checking out the contrast between colors keeping in mind that the contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+). If that was not the case, I used different tints and shades of colors.
  + I tried to use colors strategically in images and illustrations by choosing those that are near the amber color.
* Images: 
  + Storytelling photos that support the website's message. 
  + I tried to use original photos but I did not have a good camera so I choose Unsplash images avoiding generic images.
*  Icons
   + To provide visual assistance to text
* Shadows
  + I used it to provide a more playful and fun personality to the website (for cards, and buttons)
  + I tried to use it in small doses. 
* Border radius
  + To increase the playfulness and fun of the design. 
* White space
  + I tried a hard rule: using multiples of 16px for all spacing
  + I use 128px whitespace between sections,
  + And used the proximity principle to decide the whitespace across elements and groups
* Visual hierarchy
